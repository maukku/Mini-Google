# Mini-Google

Server that searches for comics on the XKCD website (https://xkcd.com/). 
The user has an option of case sensitive or case insensitive search. Also, the user should have an option of “whole word”. 
If this option is selected, then only those entries should be returned that the title contains a word which matches the query term.
The two options can be combined with each other. Created for my Informatics 3 class
